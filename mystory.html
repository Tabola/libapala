                <h3><strong>My Story<hr/></strong></h3>
                <p>I was born in Lesotho and raised in the Eastern Cape town of eGcuwa (formerly Butterworth) in the early 80s. I attended a private primary school right through to high school but it was not well endowed and there were many limitations such as not having career guidance counselling. In that socio-historical milieu, notions such as career guidance and life purpose just did not exist and a lot was expressed in vague generalities. Looking back, I realise just how uninformed and unaware our parents and teachers were, educated as they were, about identifying and nurturing talents and strengths, discovering one’s life purpose, managing one’s interior life and self-development.</p>



                <p>That said, there was always something deep inside me, and I became more aware of it in high school, which yearned for self-knowledge and to discover my purpose in life. Every single human being possesses this yearning and capacity to seek more but due to circumstances that stirring can be suppressed and dulled into nothingness. I did not have the terminology or consciousness to express these yearnings but they existed. But God and the Universe operate in such magnificent, magical ways that I now know that despite that confusion and lack of knowledge and awareness, my talents and life purpose were revealed back then. Anecdotes related by my parents during the course of my life were also rich in clues about my purpose in life and where my talents and strengths lay.</p>



                <p>In high school, I struggled with the question: What do I want to study at University? It was a given that I would go to University and get a good job, but there was very little guidance beyond informing me of that expectation. My parents were, to the best of their abilities, very supportive and made suggestions here and there but that elusive “something” was just not clear in my mind. It was such an intense, desperate and bewildering space to be in. Because my parents were teachers and I loved my teachers and being taught, I eventually decided, still feeling bewildered, that I would be a teacher and Educational Psychologist. I even registered and studied for a BA in English and Psychology at the University of Port Elizabeth for 6 months but transferred to the National University of Lesotho to pursue Law. I honestly did not want to be a lawyer but I was not enjoying Psychology either. I just wanted to teach and help students but I found myself doing Law.</p>



                <p>Not long after graduation, the National University of Lesotho recruited me as an Assistant Lecturer in the Faculty of Law. I was teaching my beloved undergraduate Law students and guiding them in their course choices as a Faculty Tutor and also helping them to navigate their personal issues. I absolutely loved my students and took my mentorship role very seriously. By the end of my ten year tenure at the National University of Lesotho I had been appointed, at various times, Tutor, Senior Faculty Tutor, Head of Department and Deputy Dean respectively. These were stunning achievements for one so relatively young. At one point, I also held leadership positions in the academic staff union at both local and federal levels.</p>



                <p>But I yearned for more and still felt that there were certain aspects of my life purpose that remained to be revealed and fulfilled. Life has been, and continues to be, a very interesting journey and lesson-rich adventure. Like many people, I have struggled with depression, struggled to develop mastery over my mind and emotions, felt worthless and direction-less. I’ve been at rock bottom and in what felt like free-fall with no bottoming-out in sight but such experiences are very necessary for us to lead complete, fearless, purposeful lives. It is only when I became a Certified Life Coach that it all made sense. We are the authors of our incredible life stories and we get to choose, consciously or unconsciously, what story we are telling and what story we will tell. Mine is a story of triumph over adversity, learning and continuous development, openness to adventure and new knowledge and ways of thinking.</p>
